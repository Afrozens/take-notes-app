# "CRUD - Take Notes App"
## Project Description:
Web application that by means of a fake api that provides JSONPlaceholder we manipulate data for the application by means of REST API. 
In the application we can create our notes, edit and delete them, inspired by the design of Notion and UI    designs achieved on the web. 
Focused on productivity for the user and trying to make the development have the best performance to produce a fast and simple application.
### Technologies:

- React Router Dom
- React Query
- React Copy to Clipboard
- React Hot Toast
- Json Placeholder
- Daisy UI
- Uuid
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind
- Vite
## Api: 
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Afrozens/take-notes-app
### Important about api
The API is fake so you will only be able to get the data provided by the api in JSON format through the demo. 
 To be able to interact with the other HTTP methods you have to install the [Json-Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) dependency and follow these steps:

#### Specifically these steps:
- 1) Cloning the repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

```
git clone https://github.com/Afrozens/take-notes-app.git 
```
- 2) Install dependency
```
npm install
```
- 3) Raising the fake backend of the api
```
node server.cjs
```
- 5) Open another tab in the terminal...Raising the development server
```
npm run dev
```


### Implement in the future:
- The user can upload images in his notes. (**NO-CHECKED**).
- Improve performance and user experience (**NO-CHECKED**)
- Implement more Notion style functionalities (**NO-CHECKED**)
